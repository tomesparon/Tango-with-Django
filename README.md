# Tango-with-Django
An exercise into Django Framework Web Development

####Dependancies
+ Python 2.7.13 (latest 2.7)
+ Django 1.5.4

#####Optional

Virtualenv

Pillow

##Get started
I installed the Windows version of Python 2.7 and then used `setuptools` to install pip. Once pip was installed, a virtualenv was created in my user directory with a 'copy' of python with the dependancies installed there.

To run place all the files in the Scripts folder that holds pip and python exe's in a folder eg Django Project.

Open the folder with the manage.py and run this:

`python manage.py runserver`

And open the following URL in your web browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/
